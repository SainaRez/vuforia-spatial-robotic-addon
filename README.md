# vuforia-spatial-robotic-addon

The vuforia-spatial-robotic-addon contains the hardware interfaces for robotic systems. This hardware interfaces are prepared to be used for motion control and path planning.

Currently, the system contains robotic interfaces for 1 robotic system:
* **[MIR100 AGV](https://www.mobile-industrial-robots.com/en/solutions/robots/mir100/)**

Each robotic addon contains the code needed to connect to each robot and a folder with tools.
The tools folder has UI interfaces for different applications. 
Currently, the main tool contained in the hardware interfaces is the KineticAR tool. The KineticAR tool allows for motion control and path planning of the different robotic addons.
